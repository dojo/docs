DojoC
=====

DojoC is DojoCampus's "personal" subversion repository, also known as DojoCommunity repo. It acts as a sandbox for committers and contributors to work together in a public area. 

There is no 'versioning' taking place in DojoC, it is all provided via subversion from a single url:

``http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/dojoc/``

All work in DojoC is still covered under Contributor License Agreement (`CLA <http://dojofoundation.org/about/cla>`_), so if you would like write access and have a CLA on file, contact a Campus Editor in #dojo (irc.freenode.net) - Nikolai (nonken) Onken, or Peter (phiggins) Higgins are usually lurking about to answer any questions you might have. 

What's in DojoC?
----------------

Lots of experimental code, and all the DojoCampus widgets and code. For instance, the FeatureExplorer source is available in explorer/ ... There are several partially working Adobe AIR demos in demos/air/, and several widgets in sandbox/
