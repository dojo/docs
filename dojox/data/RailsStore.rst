RailsStore extends the JsonRestStore to interact properly with Ruby on Rail's REST interface.


Introduction
============

RailsStore provides the same functionality as the JsonRestStore except that it formats the request URLs to Rail's specifications, post-pending URLs with .json extension to indicate that JSON format is being requested. It will also translate Dojo Data sort attributes to query parameters for Rail's will_paginate module.

Usage
=====

See dojox/data/JsonRestStore for usage from Dojo. For setting up the REST interaction from Ruby on Rail's see Ruby code that is available here: http://github.com/ttilley/railsstore/tree/master.

Examples
========

See dojox/data/JsonRestStore for examples of Dojo usage. The attached Ruby code should contain examples on how to setup Rails.
