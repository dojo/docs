The DojoX Embed project is aimed at enabling the use of various plug-ins within the browser
(such as Flash, Quicktime, and Java applets) in a way that is consistent with the Dojo API
but opens up all the normal possibilities for communication across the JavaScript boundaries
that normally hamper the use of a plug-in within a scripting environment.

At the time of writing (Dojo Toolkit 1.3 release), ``dojox.embed`` comprises three main
constructors:

* `dojox.embed.Flash <dojox/embed/Flash>`_
* `dojox.embed.Quicktime <dojox/embed/Quicktime>`_
* `dojox.embed.Object <dojox/embed/Object>`_
