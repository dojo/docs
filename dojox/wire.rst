The DojoX Wire project is a set of functions that build a generic data binding
and service invocation library to simplify how data values across a wide
variety of widget and non-widget JavaScript constructs are accessed, updated,
and passed to and from services.  It also provides a set of widgets 
within the dojox.wire.ml package to allow for declarative data binding 
definitions in addition to the programmatic APIs.

In essense, this project is an API to provide a simplified way of doing MVC
patterns in the client.
