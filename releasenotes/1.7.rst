_TemplatedMixin, _WidgetsInTemplateMixin
----------------------------------------
A new mixin called _TemplatedMixin has been added.  It's lighter weight than _Templated and supports templated widgets which *don't* have widgets in templates.  New widgets should be built using _TemplatedMixin.   Additionally, widgets that need the widgetsInTemplate functionality should also mixin _WidgetsInTemplateMixin.

_Templated's functionality and API haven't changed.
