Dojo Developer Day 2009
=======================

Location:
Time:

Feel free to edit this page. All tasks should be assigned to a task/project manager/lead so we can track progress and check how things are going during the day. Maybe we can set up a simple dynamic chart which we can look at to see how a project is doing (a nice projects for those having long flights ;) )

Dojo documentation
------------------

* Decide on final solution for data export and wiki svn integration. Current options are:

  * Wait for moinmoin 2.0 which will have wiki <=> svn support and way better templating mechanism
  * Build a middleware to handle wiki to svn integration and fix sphinx issues

* Clean up navigation
* Restructure general doc contents (Still way to complicated to get started)

Dojo website
------------

* Create demos (fullpage) which can be showcased in CodeGlass (on frontpage) or separately
* Create company profile pages (who is using Dojo)

Website and Docs
----------------

* Fix IE CodeGlass issues

1.4

* web builder
* dojox.lang.oo.declare promoted to dojo.declare.
* Broaden the API coverage for dojox.jq

Other TODOs
