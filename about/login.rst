How to login to the Dojo Documentation Wiki
===========================================

It is easy to contribute to the Dojo Documentation and there are only have a few things you should know:

* Login at http://docs.dojocampus.org with your login credentials you created on http://my.dojofoundation.org (The docs use the same login data)
* Simple grammatical edit's are accepted from all, but if you are serious about contribution we will need a `DojoFoundation CLA <http://dojofoundation.org/cla>`_ on file to ensure we may freely distribute these docs always.
* `How to write Dojo Documentation <howto>`_
