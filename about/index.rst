Welcome to Dojo Toolkits new official documentation pages.

The documentation is aiming to cover all dojo modules delivered within a release. 

This is an open effort for anyone interested to join. If you are missing things or have ideas, don't hesitate to contact the documentation team or - better - read the Documentation guidelines and start to insert your own bits of knowledge.

  Please read the `documentation howto <howto>`_. before starting writing docs
