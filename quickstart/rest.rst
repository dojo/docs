You find yourself banging your head against the wall, because you hear all the "cool kids" are using REST and you see
there is quite an extensive implementation of RESTful clients in dojo, and your boss says "I want some of that".  Well,
hopefully this tutorial can help you out.

First you have to accept what REST is and isn't.  Then you have to understand how Dojo uses REST and then finally you
can consider what you need to do to implement REST on the server side.  While this tutorial will try to be generic, my
current service side language of choice is PHP, so most of my server side explanations will likely be in the context of
PHP.

Basics of RESTful Services
==========================

A lot of people stumble across RESTful services and expect to find a well fleshed out standard with some hard and fast
rules.  That is the first thing you have to get over when it comes to REST.  REST is a convention or pattern. It is
basically leveraging the HTTP protocol and methodology to provide hierarchical data services.  The fates of the
provider and consumer are inexplicably linked.

Personal commentary, is that standards like SOAP and XML-RPC and XML, which have driven technology for the past decade,
have given us this false sense that any provider can talk to any other consumer without knowing an iota about each
other.  This is simply silly.  Very few people implement a provider or consumer without some level of conversation or
dialogue.  The technology community has heaped and layer upon layer of structure to protect providers from consumers
and in my opinion, REST gets back to basics of implementing basic CRUD functions in a simple and logical way.

The side affect of this simplicity, is that the provider and consumer need to know each other very well and they need to
trust each other to a certain degree.  But this really was the way it was before, but other standards just pretended to
save us from that, but were never fully realised.

What is a RESTful Service?
--------------------------

REST stands for Representational State Transfer.  It basically leverages the HTTP protocol and model to provide data
services.  What REST should be is follow a client/server model, be stateless, cacheable, allow for a layered model and
provide a uniform interface.

All resources are identified by the use of a URI, and there are two types of URIs used, collection URIs and element
URIs. For example, let's assume we have a server that is providing data about users.  The following URI would refer to
the users:

.. html ::

    http://example.com/users/

Now if we wanted to refer to just a specific user, we would add the specific resource identifier to the URI.  For
example:

.. html ::

    http://example.com/users/1/

This would refer to the user who has an identity of ``1``.

Building on the resource identification, all the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) functions are available via the
use of the HTTP protocol verbs.  The main ones being ``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT`` and ``DELETE``.  Different parts of a
collection can be specified by adding another collection identifier after an element identifier in the URI.  Also, a
provider could provide access to data in different ways in a fashion that is most logical.  For example, users might
have a set of groups they belong to.  A provider could provide the groups the user belongs to by using the following
URI:

.. html ::

    http://example.com/users/1/groups/

And provide all the possible groups via the URI:

.. html ::

    http://example.com/groups/

And even provide all the users that are part of a specific group:

.. html ::

    http://example.com/groups/1/users/

REST provides a fair amount of flexibility up to the provider to determine what and how they provide.

One important thing to note is that REST is independent from the data that transports it.  It is expected that the
server and the client will negotiate on how the data is represented.  The most common (especially in Dojo) way to
return data is JSON, although XML, Text or any other data format could easily be used.  It will just be assumed here
that JSON will be used without further explanation.

HTTP Verbs
----------

The HTTP protocol verbs in REST allow for traditional CRUD functions to happen. Each of the verbs and how they are used
are detailed below.

GET
~~~

The HTTP verb ``GET`` is used to list or retrieve resources.  For collections, the service should return an array of
items that are members of the collection. These can be the full details, or just information on where to find the
additional data about each resource.  So the following:

.. html ::

    GET http://example.com/users/

Would retrieve something like:

.. js ::

    [
          {"id": 1, "userName": "jsmith", "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Smith"},
          {"id": 2, "userName": "jdoe", "firstName": "Jane", "lastName": "Doe"},
          {"id": 3, "userName": "bill", "firstName": "Bill", "lastName": "Keese"}
    ]

While requesting a specific resource like:

.. html ::

    GET http://example.com/users/1/

Would return just the object:

.. js ::

        {"id": 1, "userName": "jsmith", "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Smith"}


POST
~~~~

The HTTP verb ``POST`` is used to create new resources.  Again, REST does not specify how the data is sent, it could be
traditional form encoded data, but both the Dojo implementations of REST will ``POST`` new records, and expect the
server to provide the appropriate location URI for the new resource.  The server should respond with a ``Location:``
response header like:

.. html ::

    Location: http://www.example.com/users/4/

PUT
~~~

The HTTP verb ``PUT`` is used to "replace" the content of an existing object with the provided content.  If a collection
URI is specified, the entire data set should be replaced with the provided one, where as an element URI would replace
that specific element.

DELETE
~~~~~~

The HTTP verb ``DELETE`` is used to delete resources.  If a collection URI is specified, the whole collection should be
deleted.  If an element URI is specified, just that specific item should be deleted.

OPTIONS
~~~~~~~

While not currently implemented in either of the JSON REST consumers in Dojo, some RESTful implementations use the HTTP
verb ``OPTIONS`` to provide information about what verbs can be supplied for a specific URI.  This would allow a
consumer to determine if a resource could be added, updated or deleted.

Dojo and REST
=============

The Dojo RESTful consumers are fairly straight forward when it comes to REST, and there is essentially feature parity
between both the :ref:`dojo.store.JsonRest <dojo/store/JsonRest>` and the
:ref:`dojox.data.JsonRestStore <dojox/data/JsonRestStore>`.  As Dojo moves away from the DataStore API to the new Store
API, developers can expect that dojo.store.JsonRest will become the main focus of RESTful implementation in Dojo.
Currently though, most data aware widgets only consume the DataStore API, although "wrapping" the dojo.store.JsonRest
with the :ref:`dojo.data.ObjectStore <dojo/data/ObjectStore>` is possible.

dojo.store.JsonRest
-------------------

Introduced in Dojo 1.6, the dojo.store.JsonRest is a good an efficient implementation of a RESTful consumer.  To make it
have feature parity with the :ref:`dojox.data.JsonRestStore <dojox/data/JsonRestStore>`, the developer should wrap the
store in :ref:`dojo.store.Observable <dojo/store/Observable>` and :ref:`dojo.store.Cache <dojo/store/Cache>`.

The :ref:`dojo.store.JsonRest <dojo/store/JsonRest>` defaults to assuming the identifier property of each element is
``id``, therefore if your provider returns an elements identifier in that field, most developers simply need to specify
the target URI for the collection.

An example of programmatically creating a full featured store would be:

.. js ::

    var userMemoryStore = new dojo.store.Memory();
    var userJsonRestStore = new dojo.store.JsonRest({target: "/users/"});
    var userStore = new dojo.store.Cache(userJsonRestStore, userMemoryStore);

More details can be found in their respective Dojo documentation pages.

dojox.data.JsonRestStore
------------------------

Introduced in Dojo 1.2, the :ref:`dojox.data.JsonRestStore <dojox/data/JsonRestStore>` has been the "workhorse" of Dojo
DataStores.  It provides the :ref:`Read <dojo/data/api/Read>`, :ref:`Identity <dojo/data/api/Identity>`,
:ref:`Write <dojo/data/api/Write>` and :ref:`Notification <dojo/data/api/Notification>` dojo.data APIs.

An example programmatic declaration would be:

.. js ::

    var userDataStore = new dojox.data.JsonRestStore({
      target: "/users/",
      idAttribute: "id"
    });

An example of declarative would be:

.. html ::

    <div data-dojo-type="dojox/data/JsonRestStore" data-dojo-id="userDataStore"
        data-dojo-props="target: '/users/', idAttribute: 'id'"></div>

*Note* it is necessary to use ``data-dojo-id`` with non-Widget (dijit) declarative objects, like DataStores in order to
make available a JavaScript variable that can be passed to other declarative objects.  Also it should be noted that
these objects do not get destroyed if their containing widget is destroyed and the variable is declared in a global
scope.

RESTful Conventions the Dojo Way
--------------------------------

Both the :ref:`dojo.store.JsonRest <dojo/store/JsonRest>` and :ref:`dojox.data.JsonRestStore <dojox/data/JsonRestStore>`
provide some enhancements to the basic RESTful functionality.

Query
~~~~~

Sorting
~~~~~~~

Widgets can specify sorting and those are passed as part of the query string of the URI on the ``GET``.  The sort is
specified by the `sort` attribute in either the ``store.get()`` or ``datastore.fetch()`` function.  This gets converted
into a query attribute named ``sort`` with a comma separated list of attributes with a ``+`` or ``-`` indicating if the
attributes should be sorted ascending or descending.  For example, the following sort value:

.. js ::

    {sort: [
      {attribute: "id"},
      {attribute: "userName", descending: true}
    ]}

Would translate into the following:

.. html ::

    GET http://example.com/users/?sort(+id,-userName)

Ranges
~~~~~~

Widgets can (and do) specify a ``start`` and ``count`` attributes when accessing data.  These get translated by the
Store or DataStore specifying the ``Range`` HTTP header.

For example, the following:

.. js ::

    {
      start: 5,
      count: 10
    }

Would result in the following HTTP request header being sent:

.. html ::

    Range: items=5-15

Any server should respond by setting the ``Content-Range`` header with the value of the range of items being returned
and a total counts of all of the items that could be returned based on the query.  Because the total possible items is
returned, the downstream widgets will "know" there are more items which they can retrieve.  Also the provider should
respond with the amount of items they are returning, even if more items are being requested.

So, if a request was for a count of 10 items starting at 5, but there are only 10 items in total, the following HTTP
response header should be set:

.. html ::

    Content-Range: items 5-9/10

`Note` ``start`` is 0 based, so starting at ``5`` means the 6th item.

JSON the Dojo Way
-----------------

While JSON is a great way of describing arbitrary objects, it doesn't have a standard for referencing.  The good news is
that Dojo solves that via :ref:`dojox.json.ref <dojox/json/ref>` which provides everything you need.  It is also
generally used by the rest of the framework, including the JSON REST datastores and stores.  This gives you quite a bit
of flexibility in how you provide data.

Mainly, it focuses on the attribute name ``$ref`` which provides a "pointer" to the rest of the data.  In a REST
services, this is a URI.  When a client requests the data from the store, and the store doesn't have it, it will
attempt to fetch the data at the supplied URI.  The typical way this is used is on collection URIs to provide
references to the full resource, when you only want to provide a portion of the data up front. For example, let's
assume you want to provide information about pages of a book and you have the following collection URI:

.. html ::

    GET http://example.com/book/1/page/

Which returns an array that provides some basic information, but not the content of the page, but a reference to the
item:

.. js ::

    [
      {"id": "page/1", "chapter": "1", "$ref": "page/1"},
      {"id": "page/2", "chapter": "1", "$ref": "page/2"},
      {"id": "page/3", "chapter": "1", "$ref": "page/3"}
    ]

And then something tries to attempt to access an attribute of a page that isn't loaded (like ``text``) the store will
attempt to do the following:

.. html ::

    GET http://example.com/book/1/page/1/

Which could result in you returning the whole object, that would have been inefficient until the consumer needed the
data:

.. js ::

    {
      "id": "1",
      "chapter": "1",
      "text": "..."
    }

The other main way to use ``$ref`` in a REST environment is to specify children. Again, speaking about a book, we could
provide a reference back when a request is made to a collection or resource URI:

.. html ::

    GET http://example.com/book/1/

Would return something like:

.. js ::

    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "My Little Book of Dojo",
      "author": "Kitson Kelly",
      "children": {"$ref":"1/page"}
    }

There is a lot more you can do with referencing, but viewing the :ref:`dojox.json.ref <dojox/json/ref>` page is the best
way to get a complete picture.  Just remember that your references should contain a relative URI to the appropriate
information.

Server-Side Implementation
==========================

As stated before, a lot of the structure of a provider's data is based on its application and how it will be consumed.
Some Widgets have specific expectations of how data is structured than can drive the need of how it is provided.  There
are however some general concepts of how a JSON REST store expects things to be handled and some general good practices.

General Structure
-----------------

However you implement your RESTful service, you need to provide some basic functionality:

 * Handle HTTP requests
 * Provide HTTP responses
 * Encode return data in JSON
 * Decode POSTed and PUTed data from JSON
 * Handle ranges, sorting and querying/filtering as almost every Widget expects one or all of these to be supported

Other things you might want to consider:

 * Support compression, since you are returning data and most browsers support it, you can save a lot of bandwidth by
   supporting it.
 * Support other content types other than JSON, so that other data can be retrieved from your RESTful service.
 * Provide method invocation to perform a server side service.
 * Error handling and logging

The following sections deal with the main areas that your service should provide in order to interface properly with a
consumer.

HTTP Response Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a few key, important HTTP response codes that you should consider implementing in your service.  If you
implement the response codes appropriately you will get the right behaviour out of the consumers.  While not
exhaustive, the following sections describe the main response codes you should consider using.  Generally speaking, you
should try your best to use a breadth of response codes, because at the very least it provides information to a
consumer who maybe trying to debug why something isn't working.  Even if you are the only developer, detailed response
codes can be very beneficial in understanding what is going on.

200 OK
''''''

This should be returned for a ``GET`` or another successful request where there isn't an obvious other verb, but there
is some content to return.  If there is no content to return, then ``204 No Content`` should be used instead.

201 Created
'''''''''''

This should be returned for a ``POST`` which has successfully created a new resource.  You can return content with this
as well, but it should represent the created resource, potentially with a the unique key added to the structure.

This could be coupled with setting the ``Location:`` header on the respond with the permanent URI for the resource.

202 Accepted
''''''''''''

This could be returned when a request changes something on the server, like a ``PUT`` that updates a record.

204 No Content
''''''''''''''

This should be used whenever there is no content to send back, but the request was successful.  This is often the proper
response for a successful ``DELETE``, since the record no longer exists, so there is no data to return.  You shouldn't
confuse this with an empty result set.  If a ``GET`` does not return any records, it is more appropriate to return a
``200 Ok`` and an empty array as the content:

.. js ::

    []


400 Bad Request
'''''''''''''''

This response code could be used for situations where the consumer has made a request which your service cannot
understand.  This could indicate a malformed URI in this services particular context, for example.

404 Not Found
'''''''''''''

This should be returned when a specific resource URI is not found.  This should not be used for an empty collection.  In
this case an empty array should be returned, with a ``200 OK`` response code.

405 Method Not Allowed
''''''''''''''''''''''

This could be used to indicate that a particular verb is not applicable for this service.

406 Not Acceptable
''''''''''''''''''

This could be used to indicate that a particular verb is not applicable for this service.

409 Conflict
''''''''''''

This could be used to indicate that a ``POST`` or ``PUT`` cannot be completed due to a conflict of resources.  This
could indicate to the consumer that they need to change something with the request in order to properly ``POST`` or
``PUT`` a resource.

500 Internal Server Error
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

This should be used in a situation where the requested URI cannot be responded to and there is no other more specific
response code.  It could be used as the "default" response code until the request is processed and is replaced by a
more appropriate response.

501 Not Implemented
'''''''''''''''''''

This can be returned in cases where you don't have a particular verb implemented, although this is more a convention
than a requirement. ``500 Internal Server Error`` is sufficient, but it might help in debugging of a consumer to know
that what they are asking for is specifically not implemented, versus simply being a server error.

HTTP Headers Received
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some headers that your service is expected to handle.  If you don't handle these headers properly than you can
end up with unexpected results in the dojo consuming stores and any widgets that rely upon them.

Range
'''''

This header will specify a range of results to return for a particular request. See `Ranges`_ above for detailed
information on how this should be handled.


HTTP Headers Sent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the request and how your service has filled it, there are different HTTP response headers that you may need
to set.

Content-Range
'''''''''''''

If you received a ``Range:`` request header, you should set the ``Content-Range:`` response header.  See `Ranges`_ above
for detailed on how this should be handled.

Content-Type
''''''''''''

If you are returning content, you should be setting the ``Content-Type`` on the response.  Typically this will be
``application/json``.

Location
''''''''

You can specify the ``Location:`` header to let the consumer know the "real" location of the requested URI.  Typically
this is used when the consumer POSTs a new resource, which now has a specific resource URI.  See `POST`_ above for
further details.

Converting between SQL and REST
-------------------------------

If you are using an underlying relational database, versus a database that is designed for RESTful services, like
CouchDB, then it is likely that you will have to convert from the RESTful conventions to SQL.  It is important that you
try your best to avoid introducing "attack vectors" in your services by malicious individual using SQL injection via
your service.
