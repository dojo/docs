Introduction
============

dijit/focus is a utility module that is used to manage focused nodes and widgets on a page.
It can be used to track changes to the currently focused node/widget, register and unregister handlers for detecting focus changes in windows and inline frames, and programmatically focus nodes.

Until Dojo 2.0, requiring dijit/focus will also create a ``dijit.focus`` function with the same semantics as ``focus.focus``.

Usage
=====

Focusing an element
-------------------

.. js ::
 
  require([ "dijit/focus", "dojo/dom", "dojo/domReady!" ], function(focusUtil, dom){
    focusUtil.focus(dom.byId("foo"));
  });

Note that this function only accepts DOM nodes, not widget instances.
The element to focus must also be focusable (a form element, or another element with a ``tabindex`` attribute).

Unfocusing an element
---------------------

.. js ::
 
  require([ "dijit/focus" ], function(focusUtil){
    focusUtil.curNode && focusUtil.curNode.blur();
  });

Determining the currently focused element
-----------------------------------------

.. js ::
 
  require([ "dijit/focus" ], function(focusUtil){
    var activeElement = focusUtil.curNode; // returns null if there is no focused element
  });

Watching for focus changes
--------------------------

.. js ::
 
  require([ "dijit/focus" ], function(focusUtil){
    var handle = focusUtil.watch("curNode", function(name, oldValue, newValue){
      console.log("Focused node was", oldValue, "now is", newValue);
    });
  });

Note that two changes will occur when element focus changes: the first change will be from the old element to ``null``, and the second change will be from ``null`` to the new element.

Tracking active widgets
-----------------------
At any point in time there is a set of (for lack of a better word) "active" or "focused" widgets,
meaning the currently focused widget and that widget's ancestors.
"Ancestor" can mean either DOM ancestor (ex: TextBox --> Form), or a logical parent-child relationship
(ex: TooltipDialog --> DropDownButton).


For example, if focus is on a TextBox inside a TabContainer inside a TooltipDialog triggered by a DropDownButton, the stack would be
TextBox --> ContentPane --> TabContainer --> TooltipDialog --> DropDownButton.

The activeStack[] parameter indicates this set of widgets, and an app can monitor changes to activeStack[] by:

.. js ::
 
  require([ "dijit/focus" ], function(focusUtil){
    focusUtil.watch("activeStack", function(name, oldValue, newValue){
      console.log("Focused widget + ancestors: ", newValue.join(", "));
    });
  });

An app can also monitor widget-focus / widget-blur events to tell when widgets enter or leave the stack:

.. js ::
 
  require([ "dijit/focus" ], function(focusUtil){
    focusUtil.on("widget-focus", function(widget){
      console.log("Focused widget", widget);
    });
    focusUtil.on("widget-blur", function(widget){
      console.log("Blurred widget", widget);
    });
  });

Listening for focus changes in iframes
--------------------------------------

If you donâ€™t register an iframe, when focus changes to elements within the iframe, it will not be correctly picked up by dijit/focus (``curNode`` will remain ``null``).
Registering the iframe allows dijit/focus to determine which iframe currently has focus, but does *not* tell you which specific element *inside* the iframe has been focused.

.. js ::
 
  require([ "dijit/focus", "dojo/dom" ], function(focusUtil, dom){
    // when elements in myIframe are focused, curNode will point to myIframe
    var handle = focusUtil.registerIframe(dom.byId("myIframe"));

    // we can also unregister the iframe later
    focusUtil.unregisterIframe(handle);
  });
